          <p class="lead">Mt. Carmel Christian School was very instrumental in my life and I am elated to share with you some of the strengths the education there has given me.  I attended the school from third grade until graduation.  I continued my education at the United States Air Force Academy.  I have completed a Masters of Arts in Management Degree from Regent University in 1999; and am currently earning a Masters of Science in Management Degree at the Air Force Institute of Technology. The strength of the education at MCCS was not only in the academics; it was also in the values that the institution espoused.  The goal of any education is to give the student the ability to reason and think critically, and MCCS was the enabler that developed my critical thinking skills.  The values that were taught and lived out encouraged such attributes as integrity, commitment, respect, and service to others before self.  This gave me a solid foundation not only for learning, but for life. The academics at Mt. Carmel also gave me a strong background to compete well with others from much larger public institutions.  My first semester at the Air Force Academy I felt well prepared academically, while others I knew could point to educational holes not filled by their high school programs.  The teachers at Mt. Carmel are really the backbone of the school.  I remember the principal, Mr. Edwards, would teach current events to us each Friday.  He was able to use this time to generate interest in international policy, the political system, and world-shaping events.  There are many great memories, countless of which were formed because of the example or sacrifice of a teacher. I cannot encapsulate here every benefit I derived, but hopefully this illustrates the value of the education that is offered at Mt. Carmel Christian School.  </p>

          <p class="lead">       I attended MCCS for all thirteen years, and I am so thankful for the wonderful Christian education that I received.  The standard of education is very high at Mt. Carmel.  I heard many times throughout my high school years that the courses I was taking were “college prep.”  I was confident that I was being adequately prepared for college.  The courses, such as chemistry, physics, and biology, were tough classes with real assignments and hands-on labs.  I had excellent teachers who were always willing to spend as much one-on-one time with their students as needed.  In my math classes, my teacher did not just stand before us and lecture; he got us out of our chairs and in front of the chalkboard.  My teachers expected excellence, in everything from book reports to math homework; to how our lockers looked each morning. When I started into the nursing major at Bob Jones University, I knew that it would be difficult.  However, from the courses I took while at Mt. Carmel, I found that I was more than adequately prepared and the transition was easy.  The Bible, history and science classes that I took were tough, but so were the ones I took in high school.  My new teachers expected excellence, and that learning environment was similar to the one from which I had just graduated. I have a scrapbook full of memories from MCCS.  I have pictures upon pictures of terrific field trips that were the highlights of the school year.  Many of the friends I made at Mt. Carmel are still close contacts today. My experience there was a very rich one.  Not only do I feel that I received the best education, but I was blessed also by wonderful, personal teachers, extracurricular activities, and scores of memories.</p>

          <p class="lead">My name is Dr. Samuel Bigley, and I am a graduate of Mt. Carmel Christian School.  My elementary experience there was a very positive one, with dedicated teachers whose interest was in the students and focusing on the fundamentals of reading, writing, and mathematics.  I especially remember my second grade teacher, Mr. Sprinkle, who sparked my interest in becoming an avid reader and challenged me to do my best. During my junior and senior high years, I was involved with the soccer and basketball teams.  I was privileged to work under some great coaching, and through teamwork we won many trophies for the school.  My years on the yearbook staff were challenging, and gave me a terrific foundation on which to build my now very proficient computer skills. When I think of MCCS, I have to say that Mr. Sherwood Edwards, principal and math teacher, was very influential in my life.  Though often firm and strict with me as a student, he was a real testimony to me and became a mentor to me through his teaching abilities, encouragement, and Christian example. After graduation from Mt. Carmel, I received my B.S. Degree from Grove City College in the Pre-Optometric program.  I then completed my Doctor of Optometry degree at the Pennsylvania College of Optometry, and am now in private practice.  I feel that MCCS prepared me well for my college years, and gave me the skills that I needed to compete academically in two very intense collegiate programs.</p>

          <p class="lead">    We chose Mt. Carmel Christian School because we wanted an environment where our children are taught the same virtues we teach at home; and where they are challenged academically.  The teachers at Mt. Carmel are dedicated to teaching and caring about our children just as our children are dedicated to learning and love going to school knowing that they are safe, respected, and cared about. Mt. Carmel exceeded my expectations in educating our college student son, who throughout his thirteen years at Mt. Carmel was an average but challenged student.  In a collegiate environment where he competed with students who  received a public school education, he was an exemplary student.  We must conclude that he received a great foundation at Mt. Carmel.  This program is innovative and unique, as it enhances positive relationships between students and teachers by keeping students together each year to take core courses with many of the same teachers; thus increasing the support students receive from their classmates, teachers, and other adults.  Because they stay together over a period of two or more years, they will have the ability to foster trust and familiarity between students and teachers; this is a component that most public school programs have been unable to develop. The school has been an incredible experience for our family.  The standard of academic excellence and the emphasis on moral and character development has far exceeded our expectations, which are quite high.  The practical side is that everything is in place to have an optimal learning environment.  Our children have not only been challenged academically, but have learned life skills they will retain the rest of their lives.  Mt. Carmel has truly been a blessing to our family!
