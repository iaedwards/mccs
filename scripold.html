            <p class="lead">MCCS has instituted a tuition-assistance program called “Shop with SCRIP.” Deriving its name from a term for “substitute money,” the SCRIP program allows for the purchase of  “SCRIP” for everyday expenses like food, clothing, and entertainment with a percentage of each SCRIP dollar going towards the cause—in this case, your tuition bill.  SCRIP is thus a “no-selling” fundraiser!</p>

            <p class="lead">If you prefer to use the program, any profit (minus a small processing fee) will be deducted from your regular tuition bill.  You may not raise more with SCRIP then the total of your tuition bill; however, you may indicate a student outside of your family to receive your profits in order to help them lower their bill if you wish.</p>

            <p class="lead">The effectiveness of SCRIP is simple: families generate revenue through purchases they would make anyway. Groceries, clothing, toys, gifts, and even gasoline can be purchased with SCRIP. An organization of 150 families easily spends between one and two million dollars per year on food, clothing, and other essentials. Should these families use SCRIP for such purchases, they would raise as much as $40,000 to $80,000 per year for their organization—without spending an additional penny.  Again, for MCCS parents, the money earned goes directly toward their tuition bill or that of any student they designate.</p>

                        <div class="content" style="text-align: left;"> MCCS has instituted a tuition-assistance program called &#39;Shop with Scrip.&#39; Deriving its name from a term for substitute money, the Scrip program allows for the purchase of  &#39;Scrip&#39; for everyday expenses like food, clothing, and entertainment with a percentage of each Scrip dollar going towards the cause -- in this case, your tuition bill.  Scrip is thus a  &#39;no-selling&#39; fundraiser! This amazingly successful fundraising program has worked for thousands of schools similiar to Mount Carmel! Scrip turns everyday shopping into cash for MCCS when families use retail gift cards to pay for everyday purchases (like gas and groceries) instead of the usual credit/debit card or other money. Earn money for Mt. Carmel using gift cards for everything you buy &ndash; groceries, gas, you name it!

                        <h2>How It Works</h2>
                        <div class="content row">
                          <div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Good news: It&rsquo;s really simple!</strong><br /> &nbsp;<br /><strong>The Basics of a Scrip Program</strong></div>
                            <ul>
                              <li style="text-align: left;">MCCS&nbsp;school families&nbsp;buy retail gift cards from nearly 400 national retail stores where they already shop. Click <a href="documents/scripcompanylist.pdf" download="Scrip Participating Retailers" >here</a> for a full retailer list.</li>
                              <li style="text-align: left;">Retailers offer a fundraising profit on the gift cards at&nbsp;1-13% of the face value&nbsp;(varies by retailer).</li>
                              <li style="text-align: left;">These earnings go directly toward your designated child's tuition.</li>
                            </ul>

          <p><strong>Here&rsquo;s an Example</strong></p>

                <p style="text-align: left;">Mrs. Smith needs some gardening supplies, so she buys a $100 The Home Depot&reg; gift card for $100 from the MCCS Office. Cha-ching! She just earned $4 off her tuition because The Home Depot gift cards offer a 4% profit on the value of the cards. When Mrs. Smith checks out at The Home Depot, she pays with her gift card instead of using a credit or debit card!&nbsp; She will do the same thing when she needs cleaning supplies at Target&reg;, and reduce her tuition cots by $2.50 just by using a $100 Target GiftCard to pay for her purchases.</p>

                        <h2>Why Scrip is Better</h2>

                        <div class="content row">
<div style="text-align: left;">
<div style="text-align: left;">Most fundraising programs sell &ldquo;stuff.&rdquo; &nbsp;Supporters buy the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; to &ldquo;help you out.&rdquo; (i.e. &ldquo;<em>How little can I spend?</em>&rdquo;). With scrip, there&rsquo;s no need to sell &ldquo;stuff.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Top Scrip Program Benefits</strong></div>

<ol>
  <li style="text-align: left;">No selling or unwanted goods to family and friends.</li>
  <li style="text-align: left;">Earnings add up fast!&nbsp; It&#39;s easy for a single family to generate $600 to $1000 or more per year</li>
  <li style="text-align: left;">MCCS credits the family earnings towards their tuition or that of a designated student.</li>
</ol>

<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><strong>Top Family Benefits</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Plan ahead to buy groceries, gas and other household expenses with gift cards from scrip.</li>
  <li>Shop in-store or online with participating retailers.</li>
  <li>Use gift cards to pay at checkout, just like using a credit/debit card, but without the fraud risk.</li>
  <li>Scrip program earnings are much greater than credit card rewards.</li>
  <li>No unnecessary spending, families spend their planned household budget at stores they already frequent.</li>
</ol>
